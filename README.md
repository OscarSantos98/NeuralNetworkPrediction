# NeuralNetworkPrediction
This is the repository for all the files related to my reseach internship in Japan. This includes the final presentation, the report and the code.

# Presentation
I truly recommend you to download an watch it in Powerpoint since I made some animations in some slides.

# Report
Final report is about to be finish, future improvements will be done. More references must be added and advantages of this work will be in this report.

# Code
The code is jupyter notebook file and I recommend you to open it with google colaboratory environment because I am using some libraries of Google colab to enter the data files and also due to the fact that its GPU was used for the training of the artificial neural network.
A preview can be seen if you click on the file and wait a few seconds.

For any questions please contact me.
